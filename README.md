## Introduction

Predicting student performance is crucial for educational institutions to identify at-risk students and provide timely interventions. This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates student performance based on demographics, academic history, and other relevant factors.  Accurate performance prediction can help educators personalize learning strategies and improve student outcomes.

## Features

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
* **Model Training:** Trains a [mention the model used, e.g., Classification model, Random Forest Classifier] to predict student performance.
* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates model performance using relevant metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score).
* **API Endpoint:** Provides a REST API for making predictions.
* **Dockerized Application:** Packages the application in a Docker container.
* **MLflow Integration:** Tracks model experiments, parameters, and metrics.
* **Monitoring:** Includes monitoring capabilities. *(If you have this)*
